# Chapter 5: Image Restroration and Reconstruction
The original images and the resulted images after applying the algorithms of DIP that is related to this chapter, can be found in the bin folder. Each section of this chapter will have its own folder, and the images that is related to this section will be ordered according to the order of the algorithms that were applied on them. And the order of these algorithms will have the same order of their appearances in this section of the 4th edition of the DIP book. 

**Note#1** There are some issues in the reconstructed images from the standard inverse filtering, Wiener filter, and constrained LS filtering. I am not sure what is wrong with my implementation, and I will fix it later when I have time for it. And I suspect the issues are in the PSF, also, if you ("the reader") discover where are the issues in my implementation, please contact me on LinkedIn. 

**Note#2** I removed AutoPCH from the “.vs” folder, so, you might need to rebuild it using CLI or the GUI version for CMake.
